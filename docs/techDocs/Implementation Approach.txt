  Project Name: Demo App



1. Introduction
Purpose of the Document: This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating ExoPlayer into an Android application. It provides a detailed approach for the setup, configuration, and deployment of ExoPlayer for media playback functionality.

Project Overview: The goal is to integrate ExoPlayer to allow media playback (audio/video) with support for features such as play, pause, seeking, buffering, and error handling.



2. Scope
Integrating ExoPlayer to handle audio/video media playback.
Supporting features like play, pause, seek.
Handling edge cases (e.g., network issues).
Adding a simple UI for media controls (play/pause buttons).


3. Objectives
Successfully integrate ExoPlayer for playback in the app.
Provide a user-friendly interface with basic controls for media playback (play/pause).
Implement error handling states.
Ensure proper performance, especially for streams.
Test and ensure seamless media playback across different devices.


4. Implementation Strategy
Setup ExoPlayer: Install ExoPlayer using Gradle, and create a basic Android project with dependencies set up for ExoPlayer.
Create Media Playback UI: Design a simple UI with play/pause buttons and a video player view.
Implement ExoPlayer Components:
Initialize the ExoPlayer instance.
Prepare and play media content.
Handle player events (play/pause, error handling).
Integrate with Android Lifecycle: Manage player lifecycle properly by initializing and releasing the player in appropriate lifecycle methods (e.g., onStart, onStop).
Test: Validate the functionality with various media content (e.g., MP4 stream,Dash stream,HLS streams) to ensure smooth playback.



5. System Architecture & Design
The single activity(MainActivity) principle has been used.
PlayerFragment: The UI component that includes PlayerView for rendering media and Exo Player for media playback.
ExoPlayer Component: The ExoPlayer instance that manages media playback and error handling.


6. Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
UI Design: XML layouts
Media Framework: ExoPlayer
Tools
Gradle: Dependency management.
Android Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE).



7. Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Project Setup

Set up a new Android project or use an existing one.
Add dependencies for ExoPlayer in build.gradle.


    implementation("androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer:1.5.1")
    implementation("androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-dash:1.5.1")
    implementation("androidx.media3:media3-ui:1.5.1")
    implementation("androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-hls:1.5.1")

Phase 2: UI Design
Design the layout for the media player with controls (e.g., Play/Pause button).
Add PlayerView (from ExoPlayer) to the layout XML.

Phase 3: ExoPlayer Integration
Initialize ExoPlayer and set it to the PlayerView using.
Load media using MediaItem and ExoPlayer.prepare().
Implement controls (Play/Pause).
Set up an event listener for player state changes


Phase 4: Testing

Test playback with different formats (e.g., MP4, HLS,Dash).
Test the media playback under varying network conditions (e.g., Wi-Fi, mobile data).
Test edge cases like media load failure, buffering issues, etc.


8. Roles and Responsibilities
Development Team: Responsible for coding and integrating ExoPlayer, implementing the UI, and ensuring proper lifecycle management.
